    "\n",
    "Good health is very important to human life and food contribute immensely to this. Ingestion of good/healthy food is very important for sustainability of life and good health. There are quite a number of food outlets at good locations in New York. In this project we will try to find an optimal location for a restaurant. Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening a **Chinese restaurant** in **New York City**, United States of America\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are lots of restaurants in New York City, we will try to detect **locations that are not already crowded with restaurants**. We are also particularly interested in **areas with no Chinese restaurants in vicinity**. We would also prefer locations **as close to city center as possible**, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.\n"

    "## DATA\n",
    "Based on definition of our problem, factors that will influence our decision are:\n",
    "* number of existing restaurants in the neighborhood (any type of restaurant)\n",
    "* number of and distance to Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood, if any\n",
    "* distance of neighborhood from city center\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to use regularly spaced grid of locations, centered around city center, to define our neighborhoods.\n",

    "Following data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:\n",
    "* centers of candidate areas will be generated algorithmically and approximate addresses of centers of those areas will be obtained using **Python library geopy**\n",
    "* number of restaurants and their type and location in every neighborhood will be obtained using **Foursquare API**\n",
    "* coordinate of New York center will be obtained using **Google Maps API geocoding**"
